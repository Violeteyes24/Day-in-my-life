# Terminal Adventure Game

Create a `terminal_game.py` that walks the player through a captivating mini-game adventure! In each step of the adventure, the player should be presented with 2 or more options on where to go next.

Be as creative as you want with this, but make sure your code runs!

## Some ideas include:

- A space-based adventure of a crew of curious individuals exploring an unknown galaxy.
- A “Day in the Life” story that walks you through choices the main character makes based on conditions like the time of day, the actions that the player take, etc.
- A classic mini-RPG (role-playing game) with hp health points, character moves like attack/block/heal, and NPCs (non-player characters) that attacks based on a random number generator.

# My Idea

A day in the life with choices, as me.

- If character sleeps 12am above, lead to the set of choices where mostly the decisions are bad(1 good) in the morning(random), else leads to a good set of choices that you can choose.
- Goal is to make the habits chained, and make the character sleep on time.
- Wakes up the first time, on a good set of choices.
- Implement the mini-RPG game during night, represents how a person fights the urge to sleep on time or to go discord with friends on a very late night.
- Should have a programming time on the morning and afternoon
- in the programming time, I should be able to answer 10 questions, if I do not get it all right, repeat the programming test until I answer all 10 of them. The order should be in random.
- Should have at least 3 choices which are family-related
- Every event should have a time.
- Characters are Me, My mom, My grandpa and my helper
